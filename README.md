## Discription 
Just Tech News, is a website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. The aplication was bulit using Python as the backend and Python Flask framework for front end. The aplication is pawored with Python, Python Flask, SQL, SQLAlchemy, Javascript, Pricfile, HTML, CSS and Heroku. The reasone for bulding this aplication is to further my lskills as developer in python based frameworks. Please be respectful of others view on this platform. Through bulding this aplication I have learned how to bulid and deploy to the cloud a Flask API with correct project structure and necessary dependencies. I also have learned how to connect the application to an RDBMS database using SQL Alchemy to support the API model, templating to the application to allow for user interactions and perform basic DevOps and deploy to a cloud infrastructure. The next fetures of this aplication at the core will encompass machine learning algorithms to refine the UI for a user friendly experince.
